# Write a program that converts any natural number to a binary number.
# Use the stack. To convert a number, divide the number by 2,
# each time taking the remainder of the division and putting the remainder on the stack.
# Repeat the division until the number you are dividing is zero.
# Then pop and display all values from the stack.

# Sample result for number 18:

# Division	Remainder
# 18 / 2 = 9	0
# 9 / 2 = 4	1
# 4 / 2 = 2	0
# 2 / 2 = 1	0
# 1 / 2 = 0	1
# Natural number: 18
# Binary number: 10010
