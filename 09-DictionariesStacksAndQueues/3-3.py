# Define a function that returns true if the brackets (), {}, [] are used correctly in the given expression.
# Otherwise, the function returns false.
# Then write a program that checks the correctness of the expressions given below.

# Use a stack. Read the next characters of the expression.
# Skip all but the brackets. If it is an opening bracket, put it on the stack.
# If it is a closing bracket, get the item from the stack and compare whether it is a matching opening bracket.
