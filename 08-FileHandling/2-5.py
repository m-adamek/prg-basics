# Write a program that allows you to create a shopping list.
# The program takes user input from the keyboard until the user enters 0.
# Each value taken is saved to a text file 'shopping_list.txt'.

# Hint: Open the file in append mode using the 'a' (append) parameter in the open() function.

# Creates a shopping list based on product names
# entered from the keyboard.

# shopping list file name
shopping_list = 'shopping_list.txt'

# adds product name at the end of a shopping list
def add_product(file_name, product_name):
   with open(file_name,'a') as shopping_list:

# Takes next product name from the keyboard

while product != "0":
   product = input('Enter product name (0 stops): ')
   if product == '0':
      break # stops entering food names ('while' breaks)
