# In many games, the numbers one and six on dice have special meaning.
# Write a program that prints the number of dice rolled and the value True if the number rolled is 1 or 6. Sample result:
# Dice rolled: 4
# Special number (1 or 6): False

import random
dice_roll= random.randint(1,6)
is_special = (dice_roll == 1 or dice_roll == 6)
print("Dice roll: ", dice_roll)
print("Special number (1 or 6): ", is_special)
