# Define a function that sorts an array of numbers using the bubble sort
# algorithm. Use the information in the pseudocode provided earlier.
# Then, write a program that sorts the following collections of data:

# Here is the bubble sort algorithm expressed in pseudocode,
# a universal notation that is independent of the programming language:

# procedure bubbleSort(arr):
#    n = length(arr)
#    for i = 0 to n-1:
#       for j = 0 to n-i-2:
#          if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
#                swap arr[j] and arr[j+1]
#    return arr
