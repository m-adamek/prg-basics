# Most female names in Polish end with the letter "a".
# Write a program that prints the name entered from the keyboard, provided it is a female name.

# Sample result:
# Enter name: Anna
# Anna -- Polish female name

name = input("Enter a name: ")

if name[-1] == "a":
    print(f"{name} -- Polish female name")
