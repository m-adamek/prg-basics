# A washing machine allows you to wash a jacket, which takes 40 minutes, wash underwear, which takes 70 minutes,
# and wash shoes, which takes 20 minutes. In addition, it is possible to program an additional rinse (15 minutes)
#  and an additional spin (9 minutes). The washing machine settings are saved in variables.
# Write a program that calculates and prints the total washing time.

# Sample result:
# washing_product = "shoes"
# rinse = True
# spin = False
# Total washing time: 35 minutes
