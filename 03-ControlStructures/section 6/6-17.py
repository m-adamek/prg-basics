# Let x and y denote the coordinates of a point on the plane.
# Write a program that determines in which quadrant of the coordinate system the point P(x, y)
# is located or on which axis it is located, or that it is located in the position (0,0) of the coordinate system.

# Sample result:
# x = 5
# y = 2
# Point P(5,2) is in the first quadrant of the coordinate system
